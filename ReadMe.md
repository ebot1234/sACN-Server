# sACN Server Program:
This program is used for sending DMX data over Ethernet.

# sACN Library:
This program was written using this library kadmium-sacn found on Github.
The only think I changed was the Sender file for sending to a defined endpoint instead of Multi-Cast.

# sACN Server Program Uses:
This program can be used to send any DMX data over Ethernet to sACN (E1.31) nodes. This program constains a bunch of different patterns you can assign to your light show.
